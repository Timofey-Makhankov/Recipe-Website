          <p>
            I was given a task to bake something with a Recipe and Blog it on
            the Website. I have decided to bake a family tradition Recipe. The
            Recipe is called "Манник". It's a Cake that uses Semolina as the
            main ingredient. I got all the Ingredients. The Semolina was hard to
            get, because it has to be "Durum Wheat Semolina" and
            <u>not</u> Corn-Semolina. Kefir is a sour Milk drink, popular in
            Slavic Countries. I was not able to find it here, but you can dilute
            Nature Yoghurt and get something similar. I made it with 3-part
            Yoghurt and 1-part Water.

          <h3 class="blog-under-title">Adding the Ingredients & Mixing</h3>
          <p>
            I added the First ingredients together. You can use a simple Whisk
            to mix it all together. But I used a stand-mixer to make my life
            easier. You then have to leave the Mix for aproximatly 10 - 15
            Minutes. I waited the whole 15 Minutes. It allows the Semolina to
            infuse with the Kefir and swell up.

          <p>
            You may have noticed, that i didn't talk about the Raisins. That's
            because I don't really like them and I skipped that step. It also
            says 100 - 200 Grams. The reason for it is, you can choose how many
            raisins you want to put in.

          <p>
            When I cook/bake something that needs and Egg, I always check, if
            it's still good or not. There a diffrent Tricks in figureing it out.
            But what I do is: I take a Glass and crack the Egg and put the yolk
            in the Glass. If the Egg is not broken, it is healthy. If it is
            broken, it is not healthy and i throw it away.

          <p>
            In the Recipe, you have to add in the Butter. It is Smart to leave
            the butter to thaw out and become soft. I didn't do it and because i
            didn't have time, i took a pan, put in the butter and put it on low.
            When the butter was melted, i was mixing the batter and pouring the
            Warm butter. The reason is: to not cook the Egg in the Mix.

            After mixing the butter in, I added the Baking powder. This is were
            you can also add the Raisins. The Baking powder, when added to the
            batter, does a chemical reaction and makes Carbondioxide and make
            bubble in the dough to make it fluffy.

            After Everything was mixed in, I Poured it in a baking tray. I lined
            it with parchment paper, but you can also smear Butter inside the
            tray. I forgot to preheat the Oven, but that was not critical. I
            turned it on and set it to 200°C. Leave it bake around 45 - 50
            Minutes.

            To not forget about the Cake and burn it, I set a Timer for 45
            Minutes. To check, if it is cooked, you can use a toothpick. Since i
            didn't have them at home, I used a Fork with long Teeth. to be extra
            sure, after testing I waited for another 5 Minutes. In the End, you
            can tke it out and leave it to cool down a bit and cut it into
            pieces.
